Do not handcuff the fabricator.  
Tell the Tell them what impedance value 
you are targeting with what line widths and 
leave the rest to them. On your prints, please specify the 
pitch or edge pitch or edge-edge spacing for 
diff pairs. Allow them to 
modify the dielectrics/lines as needed for their processes to
achieve the required impedance by placing a note on
the fabrication drawing allowing 
this.  Remember, they are 
the ones responsible for meeting the 
required impedance.
